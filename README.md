# AutoPricer: Predicting Car MSRP with Machine Learning

## 📍 Project Description

This project aims to predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of vehicles using a variety of machine learning regression models. It demonstrates a practical application of ML to real-world datasets and is part of a professional data science portfolio by Obinna, PhD (EEE, ML, Data Science & Network Engineering).
